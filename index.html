			I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
			My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
			with a strong side interest in business process modeling with Simio.

			My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
			which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
			to develop programs for computer-based psychology experiments.
			This library is a part of my
			<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/HurPsy">HurPsy</a>
			project, which is hosted here, on GitHub.<br />
			<b>HurPsy</b> will also include a WPF Windows application
			which will help non-programmers to design psychology experiments
			without writing code.

			I have recently taken up web application development with Blazor.
			I have been sharing my applications in my
			<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/Blazor" class="inline">Blazor</a>
			project, which is open to everyone.<br />
			Its README file presents my explanations (in Turkish)
			for learners who are taking their first steps.
		</div>
		<div class="row mt-2 mb-2">
			I have also been producing projects which may help
			those who are learning visual programming.<br />
			Those who want to get started on visual programming
			on WPF framework can take a look at
			<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/BST206-2023" class="inline">BST206-2023</a>
			project.
			That one, too, explains the development steps in its README file (in Turkish).
