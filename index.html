		<p>
		    I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
		    My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
		    while I also advance myself in business process modeling with Simio.

		    My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
		    which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
		    to develop computer-based psychology experiments.
		    This library is a part of my HurPsy project which is housed on GitHub.
		    HurPsy also includes a WPF Windows application which will help
		    non-programmers to design psychology experiments.
