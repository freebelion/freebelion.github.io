<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
        My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
        and I have recently taken up business process modeling with Simio.

        While I was teaching my students about visual and object oriented programming,
        I have been inspired -and frequently taught- by them about the wonders of
        web applications.
        I intend to develop my own web applications in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
        My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
        which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
        to develop computer-based psychology experiments.
        This library is a part of my HurPsy project which is housed on GitHub.
        HurPsy also includes a WPF Windows application which will help
        non-programmers to design psychology experiments.
